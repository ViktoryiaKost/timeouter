                Innowise Sp. z o.o. (d/b/a Innowise Group) recognises that privacy is an important element of
                our society, so we want to explain how the app “Timeouter” (created by Innowise Group) works
                in a way of processing personal data.
                Processing personal data
                “Timeouter” is designed to be used by merchants in the process of interacting with buyers.
                Application collects only the following personal data: store owner name, store owner email
                address, store owner phone number, store owner location (physical address). But in some cases
                such data may not be considered as personal data (for example, if the phone number belongs to
                a company).
